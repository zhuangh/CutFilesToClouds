1. Go to the encrypto folder
2. run "make static dynamic test"
3. run "make install PREFIX=~/cryptopp"

PREFIX specifies the folder to store the .so .a .exe files


3. If we want to compile a program, we can link with the static library
    by running "g++ -o test.exe test.cpp ~/cryptopp/lib/libcryptopp.a"
