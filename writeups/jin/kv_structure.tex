\subsection{Key-Value strucutures}
To provide more convenient service for trusted bridge server, 
we design the following key value pairs. 
The first kind $<$username clouds, token array for the cloud storage$>$ 
is used to record user's tokens for different cloud storage access. 
The second kind $<$username files , filename lists$>$ record the list 
of filenames the user has uploaded. 
The key for the third one is username plus filename,
the value corresponding to it is the list of segment name. 
The fifth pair's key is username plus segment name, 
the value is the place of the cloud who has this segment. 
The last kind is the pair username and the key it specified 
when registraing a new user.
