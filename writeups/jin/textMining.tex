\subsection{Text Mining}

Text mining methods, there is no major increased computational complexity when analyzing many short documents, compared to the same number of words in fewer documents.A much more important issue is whether individual documents are well-defined in a meaningful way. Most text mining methods work best on documents whose length is a paragraph to a page. Too short documents like tweets cannot be understood well without context. Too long documents like books lack homogeneity and need to be divided into segments. The more segments the file is divided, the more diffculty will put on the analyzers. Take the TF(term frequency)-IDF(Inverted Document Frequency) algorithm to weight the keywords for a file as an example. The partitioning will change the term frequency for keywords, which will definitely change each keyword's weight. Besides, as we distributed segments to different servers, the IDF value would still change. Because these two values are changing together, it will direct user the wrong way analyzing the file, which is the target trusted bridge server want serve.
