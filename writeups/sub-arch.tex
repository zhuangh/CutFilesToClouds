Trusted Bridge provides users a convenient online storage environment without losing their privacy. To achieve this goal, we implement the system with the following structure, please see Figure~\ref{fig:arch}. We build all the blocks with blue color and take advantage from lab3 key-value storage system. The Trusted Bridge server and key-value storage server are built in sysnet clusters. The front-end web server is portable. It could be served right into sysnet clusters but it also could be run as a remote service on any Apache and PHP environment. The following sections will describe the detail implementation of each components.
