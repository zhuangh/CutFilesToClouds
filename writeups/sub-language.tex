In this implementation, we totally use at least four different programming language including HTML/CSS/JavaScript, PHP, C/C++, and Java. That was because we first write our Trusted Bridge server in C/C++ as an extension of lab3 key-value storage system. C/C++ is powerful and efficient, but it lacks cloud storage API support and HTTP request handler. The difference of programing environment slows down the development progress and the system could not take advantage from compiler level memory and CPU optimization. If we have the opportunity to redesign this system, we would like to rewrite Trusted Bridge server in Java, and the dynamic web server in JavaServer Pages (JSP). In this case, Trusted Bridge could be integrated with Dropbox or Google Drive API in JAVA much more closely. The front-end server also could talk to Java Servelet directly without the Thrift protocol overhead. The new system could be implemented with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, JSP, and Java, which is much more easy to maintain and much more efficient.
